# SOFAR-3.2
the Solar-Farm model (SOFAR, Version 3.2) describes the fundamentally physical and ecohydrological processes occurring in the solar farms at daily time step, including rainfall concentration, radiation harvesting, soil moisture dynamics, vegetation evolution, and landscape erosion, which is driven by daily meteorological variables including precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and sunshine duration. 
This code was develped for generating the results and figures reported in the manuscript "Effect of Solar Farms on Soil Erosion in Hilly Environments: A Modelling Study from the Perspective of Hydrological Connectivity".
The most recently code used for this work will be avaliable after the manuscript being published.
